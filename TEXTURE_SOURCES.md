## Tips

- **2K Textures** work best (2048x2048 pixels)
- Ensure the texture is seamless/tileable for best results
- JPG format is recommended for compatibility
- CORS-enabled URLs work directly in the browser

## Procedural Textures

The app also includes built-in procedural textures:
- **Floor**: Simulated wood parquet with planks and grain
- **Walls**: Painted surface with subtle texture variation

These are generated at runtime and require no external files.

## Creating Your Own

You can create seamless textures using:
- **GIMP** (free) with Offset filter
- **Photoshop** with Offset filter
- Online tools like **Seamless Texture Checker**
